Hey, fellow developer! Thank you for buying the Modern Doors Pack from Perpetual Diversion (that's me, writing this!)

The Modern Doors Pack features high-quality door models. They're fully interactive and include interaction sound effects.
Most of the doors in the pack feature variations of some sort, either in color, shape or behaviour.

Speaking of behaviour, this pack includes five scripts that you can attach to custom doors, if you'd like to.
The door scripts include: Basic (single), double door, automatic door, automatic double door and trap door.

There are some requirements for the scripts to work. Please refer to the door setup video here:

There's also a folder with all the prefabs without any scripts attached to them, if you want to use your own scripts.

If you'd like to contact me with feedback or to report issues, e-mail me at: marcus@perdiv.com
If you'd like to keep up with updates and upcoming assets or other projects of mine, feel free to follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/caffeinegamer

Again, thank you very much for purchasing this pack. It'll help me towards making more and better assets and developing my own games. It's a win-win situation for both of us, isn't it? :D

Sincerely,
Perpetual Diversion / Marcus Svensson
